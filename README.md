# Virtual world project

Project is an example of object oriented programming in Java. There are multiple organism in virtual world that can interact with each other. There are plants and animals. The difference between them is way of creating new examples of their species. Organisms are also different in way they move or in terms of strength or agility (moving order).

The first thing after launching program is selecting width and hight of the map. After that the random world is created. You can control "human" being by pressing arrows. Different colors of tiles mean different organisms.

Animals:
- Antelope is dark red
- Fox is orange
- Human is blue
- Sheep is grey
- Turtle is green
- Wolf is black

Plants:
- Grass is green
- Guarana is red
- Milt is yellow
- Sosnowski Borcht is red
- Wolf berry is purple


Current state of the map can be save and later loaded.
